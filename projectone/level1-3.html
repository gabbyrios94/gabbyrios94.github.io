            <p>
            Take this kiss upon the brow!
            <br>And, in parting from you now,
            <br>Thus much let me avow --
            <br><br>You are not wrong, who deem
            <br>That my days have been a dream;
            <br>Yet if hope has flown away
            <br><br>In a night, or in a day,
            <br>In a vision, or in none,
            <br>Is it therefore the less gone?
            <br>All that we see or seem
            <br>Is but a dream within a dream.
            <br><br>I stand amid the roar
            <br>Of a surf-tormented shore,
            <br>And I hold within my hand
            <br>Grains of the golden sand --
            <br>How few! yet how they creep
            <br><br>Through my fingers to the deep,
            <br>While I weep -- while I weep!
            <br>O God! can I not grasp
            <br>Them with a tighter clasp?
            <br>O God! can I not save
            <br>One from the pitiless wave?
            <br>Is all that we see or seem
            <br>But a dream within a dream?
            </p>
