    <p class="green">Take this kiss upon the brow! </p>
    <p class="red">
        <br>And, in parting from you now, 
        <br>Thus much let me avow -- 
        <br>You are not wrong, who deem 
        <br>That my days have been a dream; 
        <br>Yet if hope has flown away 
        <br>In a night, or in a day, 
        <br>In a vision, or in none, 
        <br>Is it therefore the less gone? 
        <br>All that we see or seem 
        <br>Is but a dream within a dream.</p>
    <p class="black">I stand amid the roar </p>
	<p class="blue">
        <br>Of a surf-tormented shore, 
        <br>And I hold within my hand 
        <br>Grains of the golden sand -- 
        <br>How few! yet how they creep 
        <br>Through my fingers to the deep, 
        <br>While I weep -- while I weep! 
        <br>O God! can I not grasp 
        <br>Them with a tighter clasp? 
        <br>O God! can I not save 
        <br>One from the pitiless wave? 
        <br>Is all that we see or seem 
        <br>But a dream within a dream?</p>
