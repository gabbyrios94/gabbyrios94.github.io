            <p>Take this kiss upon the brow</p>
            <br><p>And, in parting from you now,</p>
            <br><p>Thus much let me avow --</p>
            <br><p>You are not wrong, who deem</p>
            <br><p>That my days have been a dream;</p>
            <br><p>Yet if hope has flown away</p>
            <br><p>In a night, or in a day,</p>
            <br><p>In a vision, or in none,</p>
            <br><p>Is it therefore the less gone?</p>
            <br><p>All that we see or seem</p>
            <br><p>Is but a dream within a dream.</p>
            <br><p>I stand amid the roar</p>
            <br><p>Of a surf-tormented shore,</p>
            <br><p>And I hold within my hand</p>
            <br><p>Grains of the golden sand --</p>
            <br><p>How few! yet how they creep</p>
            <br><p>Through my fingers to the deep,</p>
            <br><p>While I weep -- while I weep!</p>
            <br><p>O God! can I not grasp</p>
            <br><p>Them with a tighter clasp?</p>
            <br><p>O God! can I not save</p>
            <br><p>One from the pitiless wave?</p>
            <br><p>Is all that we see or seem</p>
            <br><p>But a dream within a dream? </p>
