        <p>Gabby Rios is a San Diego native living and working in Los Angeles. She loves animals, yoga, movies and a good challenge. Coming from a family of engineers and scientists, Gabby was always the odd ball out but knew from an early age that she wanted to work in a creative field. After moving to Los Angeles and falling in love with design she has set her goals toward learning and refining her skills and creating as much as possible. Her eventual goal is to study design in Europe. </p>
